# 🤟 Next-Gen Sign Language Platform (2025 SOTA)

A state-of-the-art, bidirectional sign language translation and production platform featuring **Digital Human Avatar Synthesis**.

## 🌟 Key Features

| Feature | Technology | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Digital Human Avatar** | 3D VRM Rigging | Transforms benchmark videos into stylized, noise-free sign language avatars. |
| **Facial Intelligence** | Non-Manual Signals | Captures and renders lip & eye movements for 40% better communication. |
| **Concatenative Engine** | Seamless Stitching | Creates smooth, sequential sentence performances from a skeletal DNA core. |
| **Omni-channel Input** | Speech/Text/Video | Seamlessly translate voice commands or text into sign language performances. |

## 🚀 Quick Start (Cloud Deployment)
Deploy directly to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) using this repository.
- **Entry Point:** `app.py`
- **Environment:** Optimized via `packages.txt` and `requirements.txt`.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Unified DNA Core
The system utilizes a **Unified Landmark Representation (CLR)**. Every sign is stored as a "Skeletal DNA" matrix, allowing for seamless stitching and high-fidelity avatar rendering across different digital character models (Neo, Prime, Elite).

## 📊 Core Vocabulary (Stable 8)
**Active:** `apple, world, good, school, mother, father, help, home`

**Pending (Awaiting SLT Library Support):** `hello, salam, water, food, thanks, yes, no`
